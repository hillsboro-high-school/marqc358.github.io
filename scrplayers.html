They've made it to the second round in the playoffs but were eliminated by the Portland Trail Blazers in a record of 4-3. During game 3 with the Blazers, history was made as both teams played very hard and ended up going to 4 overtimes, although they lost 140-137! This has only happened one other time in the NBA playoffs in 1952-1953 when the Boston Celtics and the Syracuse Nationals went against eachother in the Eastern Division Semifinals.</h4></p>
