            <p class="text-center"><h4 class="text">The regular 2018-2019 basketball season for the NBA was pretty good. The Trail Blazers, Portland's team, were 3rd in the west, just right behind the Denver Nuggets who only had one more win than we did (Nuggets:54-28, Blazers:53-29). Our team managed to win the first and second round in the playoffs but unfortuneately we got eliminated in the west conference finals against the Golden State Warriors. Although we didn't make it to the finals, our team still did pretty good compared to past few series.</h4></p>

            <p class="text-center"><h4 class="text">The two teams who made it to the finals this season are the Golden State Warriors for the west and the Toronto Raptors for the east. The Golden State Warriors, a very good team which have been notorious for being hard to beat because of their stacked team, are most likely going to win the championship based off of the last few finals. The Raptors will have to play smart and hard if they want to win the championship, but they have already been playing well so I wouldn't be surprised if they won as well.</h4></p>
