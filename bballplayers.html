            <p class="text-center"><h4 class="text">The Milwaukee Bucks are a basketball team from the east, in fact, they were #1 in the east in this year's regular NBA season with the Toronto Raptors right behind them. They made it to the playoffs but were eliminated in the 3rd round of the playoffs by the Toronto Raptors, they lost the series 2-4. They played hard but not hard enough against the Raptors. Although they had been eliminated, they still did great in the regular season. They had the highest record out of every team, east or west, this season with a record of 60-22.</h4></p>

            <p class="text-center"><h4 class="text">The Bucks are an American basketball team founded in 1968, based in Milwauke, Wisconsin. The Bucks have won one league title (1971), two conference titles (1971 and 1974), and 14 division titles (1971–1974, 1976, 1980–1986, 2001, 2019). This regular season they have had a record of 60-22, which is their highest since the 1980-81 season. Thanks to Giannis Antentokounmpo, an all-star on their team, they have been doing good. He's seen on the left catching an alley oop pass and slamming down a dunk. Easily one of my favorite players.</h4></p>
