Although bested by the bucks in the regular season, the Raptors managed to beat them in the playoffs with a series record of 4-2. They are currently in the finals up agaisnt the Golden State Warriors, the #1 team for the west. They were arguably able to enter the finals thanks to Kawhi Leonard who hit an outstanding game winning shot in game 7 against the 76ers. Although this was only in the 2nd round of the playoffs, it was still a crucial shot to make if they wanted to move up. The Raptors vs Warriors series right now is tied at 1-1.</h4></p>

Currently, they have Kawhi Leonard, another amazing player, who has led them into the finals this year against the warriors.</h4></p>
