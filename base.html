            <p class="text-center"><h4 class="text">The Golden State Warriors were originally founded in Philadelphia, 1946, but has since been moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1962. They have won 3 championships in 1947, 1956 and 1975 and more recently though they've won championships in 2015, 17-18. They've made 5 straight finals appearances since 2015 so that in itself is already impressive. As you can tell, this franchise has been very successful. In fact, they're the 7th highest valued sports franchise with an estimated value of $3.1 billion!</h4></p>

            <p class="text-center"><h4 class="text">Part of the reason why the Golden State Warriors have been so successful is because of their roster. They have 5 All-Stars on their team, which are just basically really good players. Those 5 players are Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Demarcus Cousins and Klay Thompson. We have Draymond who is a decent scorer and good defender, Demarcus who is a great center, and Kevin Durant, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson are just all amazing scorers. Unfortuneately Kevin Durant has been injured and is out for the time being, but that won't stop the Warriors from doing great because they still have 4 All-Stars, 3 of which are in the starting lineup. Although this has been good for the team itself, Golden State has received a lot of hate and negative attention for having an overwhelming team. Some people say that it has "ruined the NBA" because of how they good they've been playing and how many good players they have on their team.</h4></p>
